I had the best experience ever in this hotel I could say its the best one Ive ever been to .  The staff is great the put so much detail into everything they do !  And the best I forgot my t-shirt there and they sent me an email and asked me how do I want to get it back .

Perfect stay .

We stayed here for three nights at the start of our trip and what a wonderful way to begin !  The welcome was warm and friendly - greeted personally by the owner and offered a cheese plate and a glass of wine on the house .  He talked us through our trip and gave us some great advice on where to go and what to do .  The room was plenty big enough for our requirements balcony en-suite tea and coffee facilities and water .  Bed was very comfortable and I notice there was a pillow menu although we didnt use it .

This has to be one of my best hotel experiences - ever !  And considering my family and I are travelling around the world for a year we have stayed in many hotels .  The hotel is lovely and beautifully decorated but it is the staff who made it so special .  They were willing to help with any request .  The food - especially the breakfast - was incredible !  The welcome wine and cheese was so tasty .  The location was perfect - a 0 minute walk from the Old Quarter with restaurants and cafes .  I cant say enough .  If you are travelling to Bucharest you must stay here .

A lovely hotel but I thought the hotel owner and staff are the reason this hotel gets such good reviews . Nothing you want is to much trouble . Everything is done straight away and the information was always spot on . We were welcomed with wine and cheese and as we sat enjoying that the owner invited us to a welcome party that evening where we were given plenty of drink and treated to some Romanian food . I have stayed in many hotels but I have never had this before . It was a great night meeting other guests and talking to the owner . Whenever a jug of beer or wine run out it was replaced with another all on the house . I would recommend the Hotel Christina to anybody travelling to Bucharest . Situated in a quiet road near to Piata Roman metro station and a 0 min walk to the old town . Breakfast was good and the rooms were cleaned every day in our 6 day stay .

Particularly notable was the friendliness of the staff from the moment of arrival .  We were greeted with a free cheese platter and a glass of wine and staff made us very welcome .  The hotel was immaculately clean with modern rooms fitted with free wi-fi remote controls for a large flat-screen TV many English channels remote for posture adjustable bed and curtains wonderful shower and effective heating .  Breakfast offered the greatest choice I have ever seen in a hotel of any class with a wide selection of cereals and additions to make up a muesli dish of your choice .  Eggs cooked to your specification fresh fruit and juices etc etc etc .  Again the staff were soooooo helpful whether arranging concert tickets a train journey postage restaurant advice taxis and cardriver for a trip to the Carpathians .  All in all you need look no further for comfort service delightful staff and a very reasonable room rate .  Thank you Hotel Christina for making my stay delightful .

One night only on our first trip to Romania .  Friendly helpful staff .  Great decor in reasonably well equipped rooms with a very comfortable multi function bed !  !  The welcoming wine and cheese was much appreciated after battling with trip from Bulgaria and Bucharest traffic !  About 15 - 0 min walk to Old Town for dinner .  Dan gave us a comprehensive city tour 3hrs - well worth it if you are short of time and would go back and visit some places he pointed out in more detail .  Parking can be tricky .  Best bit - the breakfast - never seen such an array of seeds nuts tea coffee juice machine full English continental etc .  Worth going for that alone .

Wee booked this hotel because of the excellent reviews and it exceeded our expectations on every count comfort convenience customer service cleanliness and hospitality  .

Stayed for one night at the end of our week in Romania .  The hotel room was clean and modern the wifi was quick and the hotel was in a good location .  There were plenty of facilities that we did not take advantage of including the health club .  We had to leave very early in the morning for a flight and the hotel staff put together a packed breakfast .  Would definitely stay there again .

A place I had never visited was Romania .  A lot of my friends had been and told me that I had to .  Our 10 year wedding anniversary was coming up and was on Valentines weekend .  I thought of Paris or Milan or Venice but then though why not Romania .  I like to visit different countries and places .  So we booked the weekend in Romania .  I searched on line for a good hotel .  For all of the hotels I found on the Internet I could not look past the Christina .  In no particular order underneath are the positives
