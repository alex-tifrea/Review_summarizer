Very clean accommodation with all conveniences for the traveller including the most helpful staff of all hotels we stayed on our East European holiday, there was nothing they would not help with. We stayed for a few days on our arrival at Bucharest and were so pleased we re-booked for our return after travelling around Romania. The included breakfast was fantastic and our 4am early rise for our flight out was all the better for their arranged transport and breakfast on the go. Welcome drink with cheese and crackers was appreciated. Highly recommended.
